Supported Quantities
--------------------

If present in the output of a calculation, the following quantities are recognised by *iago* for cp2k QS. All quantities here
consist of raw data as calculated by the simulation package itself. None of them is derived (except for unit
conversions).

If present in the output of a calculation, the following quantities are recognised by *iago* for NAMD. All quantities here consist of raw data as calculated by the simulation package itself. None of them is derived (except for unit
conversions). Any keyword starts with NAMD is either an averaged output from NAMD or not clearly defined in NAMD MANUAL.
