Which problem does iago solve?
================================

Data storage and analysis in computational chemistry is a challenge. With more and more data generated from different applications, combining them into one scientific outcome requires keeping track of the input and output files as well as the code used to generate the information.

Iago helps the user to ensure the following best practices

Documentation
  Keep all input and output files. Have access to all results through a unified database - no matter whether you used cp2k or namd to obtain them.

Reproducibility
  Know what you did and which calculation went into what graph or table. Have unique references to simulations.

Rapid Prototyping
  Gain quick insight into results by having all quantities directly available. Know what to do next.

Long-term Archiving
  No more thinking where you left the data. Iago can access your results whether they are on local disk, remote SSH hosts or cloud storage providers - all without changes to your code.
